  'decode' object holds two states: the data to be decoded and the position to
  start decoding next. The position gets updated when decode.next() succeeds.
  Because of these states, we need to handle two different cases:
    1. bencode.decode() is called the first time or when all the previous data
       has been decoded (meaning the position is at the last index), so we can
       override the previous data and just call bencode.decode() again.
    2. The previous data is only partially decoded, so the new data needs
       to be concatinated onto the previous data before decoding."
